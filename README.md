It aims to optimize the educational process through a more informed and strategic matchmaking. This is supported by the theory of "Learning Clusters" by Dr. Anthony Grasha, which suggests a direct relationship between the students' learning styles and the tutors' teaching styles.

A data collection process designed through a web application is included at the methodology level, in which the Teaching and Learning Styles Inventory Survey for Tutors and Students will be applied.

The collected data is stored, processed, and organized through data management techniques, thus establishing an interactive information repository called #PilandoAndo Learning Management System (SGE, for its acronym in Spanish) of the Ayudinga Foundation.

The research continues developing an application that implements the mathematical concept of Bipartite Graphs to match students and tutors optimally.

This procedure allows the creation of subsets of data analyzed using advanced mathematical calculation tools. This approach also considers that multiple students can be assigned to a single tutor to maximize collective learning.

 
Subsequently, these data will be analyzed by a maximum matching algorithm called Gale Shapley; however, an adaptation that aims to identify the styles of students and tutors will be used. This automated procedure ensures efficient and accurate data management, preparing it for analysis and visualization.

The results of this pairing are stored for later analysis. They are displayed through the "Administration Panel" of the #PilandoAndo SGE, providing a dashboard that presents the "Maximum Pairing" between students and tutors.

It is essential to highlight that this study also considers the limitations and restrictions of the number of students that a tutor can effectively manage, as well as by evaluating how changeable the learning and teaching styles of a student or tutor can be, so will be limited to specific adaptive measurement through human decisions.

The findings of this exploratory study will provide an effective and data-driven strategy for creating tutoring groups in the Ayudinga Foundation's massive educational interventions, known as #PilandoAndo, in its different versions.

This approach will allow for more personalized and effective teaching, benefiting tutors and students by promoting a more productive and enriching learning environment.
